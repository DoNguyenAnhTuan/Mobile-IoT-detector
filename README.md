# Welcome to your Expo app

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. **Start the backend server**

   Before running the mobile app, make sure you start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the API server that the Expo app connects to.

2. **Install dependencies for the mobile app**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the mobile app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

   * [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   * [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   * [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   * [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory.
This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Reset project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory.

Nếu bạn muốn, mình có thể làm thêm sơ đồ **flow chạy server → chạy app** cho README để người đọc dễ hình dung hơn.
Bạn có muốn mình làm luôn không?
